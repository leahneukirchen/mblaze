.Sh NAME
.Nm mless
.Nd conveniently read messages in less(1)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar msg
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs
.Xr less 1
on the output of

for the current sequence.

.Ar msg
if passed.

See
.Xr mmsg 7
for the message argument syntax.

.Pp
When no messages are passed and the standard input is from a pipe,
.Ql mseq -S
is called to set the current sequence;
.Nm
is then run on the resulting sequence.
The first "file" of the less instance will be the output of
.Xr mscan 1 .
This makes
.Nm
convenient for use at the end of a pipeline.
.Pp
.Nm
will start
.Xr less 1
and display the current message, if possible.
Use
.Sq Ic ":n"
and
.Sq Ic ":p"
to read the next (resp. previous) message.
